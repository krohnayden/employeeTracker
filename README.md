# Employee Tracker

  ## Description
  
  The employee tracker application creates and manages employee information like name, department, and role. You can view, add, and update the database using the command line and the mysql shell. Through this project, I learned about mysql and how it can create and manage active databases.

  ## Installation
  
  To install, run npm i in your command line to install the necessary packages. Then open the mysql shell and run "source db/schema.sql" and "source db/seeds.sql" to bring in database, tables, and example employee information. After running the sql files, exit the mysql shell and run "node index.js". This will activate the questions to view, add, or update information. 
  
  ## Usage

  To use the employee tracker application, you must fill in your password for application to run on line 6 of the connection.js file.
